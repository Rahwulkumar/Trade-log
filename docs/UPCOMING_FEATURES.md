## AI Trading Coach (Multi-Agent System)

### Vision
An AI system that deeply understands ICT (Inner Circle Trader) and Quarterly Theory concepts, reviews your trade history, and validates both your execution and the concepts themselves.

### Core Capabilities
1. **Deep ICT Knowledge** - Order blocks, FVGs, breaker blocks, liquidity sweeps, quarterly shifts, kill zones
2. **Trade Review** - Analyzes your tagged trades against the concepts you claim to use
3. **Probing Questions** - Asks you about specific trades to validate execution
4. **Concept Validation** - Determines if ICT/Quarterly Theory concepts are actually profitable for YOUR trading

### Implementation Approach (TBD)
- Option A: Fine-tune AI on ICT content
- Option B: Structured knowledge base the AI references

### Data Requirements
- Trades tagged with ICT concepts (FVG entry, OB entry, liquidity sweep, etc.)
- Screenshots of chart at entry
- Journal notes explaining the trade thesis
